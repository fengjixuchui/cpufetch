.SH NAME
cpufetch \- manual page for cpufetch v0.99 (Linux x86_64 build)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cpufetch
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Simple yet fancy CPU architecture fetching tool
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-color\fR
Set the color scheme (by default, cpufetch uses the system color scheme)
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-style\fR
Set the style of CPU logo
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
Print CPU model and cpuid levels (debug purposes)
.TP
\fB\-\-logo\-short\fR
Show the short version of the logo
.TP
\fB\-\-logo\-long\fR
Show the long version of the logo
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Print extra information (if available) about how cpufetch tried fetching information
.TP
\fB\-\-logo\-intel\-old\fR
Show the old Intel logo
.TP
\fB\-\-logo\-intel\-new\fR
Show the new Intel logo
.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-full\-cpu\-name\fR
Show the full CPU name (do not abbreviate it)
.TP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-raw\fR
Print raw cpuid data (debug purposes)
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print cpufetch version and exit
.SH COLORS
.TP
* "intel":
Use Intel default color scheme
.TP
* "amd":
Use AMD default color scheme
.TP
* "ibm",
Use IBM default color scheme
.TP
* "arm":
Use ARM default color scheme
.TP
* custom:
If the argument of \fB\-\-color\fR does not match any of the previous strings, a custom scheme can be specified. 5 colors must be given in RGB with the format: R,G,B:R,G,B:...The first 3 colors are the CPU art color and the next 2 colors are the text colors
.SH STYLES
.TP
* "fancy":
Default style
.TP
* "retro":
Old cpufetch style
.TP
* "legacy":
Fallback style for terminals that do not support colors
.SH LOGOS
.TP
cpufetch will try to adapt the logo size and the text to the terminal width. When the output (logo and text) is wider than the terminal width, cpufetch will print a smaller version of the logo (if it exists). This behavior can be overridden by \fB\-\-logo\-short\fR  and \fB\-\-logo\-long\fR, which always sets the logo size as specified by the user, even if it is too big. After the logo selection (either automatically or set by the user), cpufetch will check again if the output fits in the terminal. If not, it will use a shorter name for the fields (the left part of the text). If, after all of this, the output still does not fit, cpufetch will cut the text and will only print the text until there is no space left in each line 
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
Run cpufetch with Intel color scheme:
.IP
\&./cpufetch \fB\-\-color\fR intel
.TP
Run cpufetch with a custom color scheme:
.IP
\&./cpufetch \fB\-\-color\fR 239,90,45:210,200,200:0,0,0:100,200,45:0,200,200
.SH BUGS
.TP

.SH NOTE
.TP
Peak performance information is NOT accurate. cpufetch computes peak performance using the max frequency of the CPU. However, to compute the peak performance, you need to know the frequency of the CPU running AVX code. This value is not be fetched by cpufetch since it depends on each specific CPU. To correctly measure peak performance, see: https://github.com/Dr\-Noob/peakperf
